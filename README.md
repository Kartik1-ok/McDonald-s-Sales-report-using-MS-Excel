# McDonald-s-Sales-report-using-MS-Excel
This project presents a comprehensive dashboard analysis of McDonald’s sales performance, developed to uncover actionable insights into customer behavior, product demand, and revenue patterns.Using MS Excel and Power Query, the dataset was cleaned, analyzed, and visualized into interactive dashboards, highlighting both overall performance and detailed breakdowns across months, weekdays, weekends, and special occasions.

Key findings include total revenue of $61,715.91 from 5,370 orders, an average of 2.28 items per transaction, and identification of top-performing items such as the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder with Cheese. The analysis further emphasizes trends in order timing, category-wise sales, and customer preferences, while special day analyses (e.g., Valentine’s Day and Republic Day) reveal unique consumer patterns.

This project not only demonstrates expertise in data cleaning, visualization, and dashboard creation but also provides strategic insights that can help McDonald’s optimize sales, product promotions, and customer engagement strategies.
